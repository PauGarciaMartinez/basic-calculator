As it is now, this calculator offers basic functionality, but there's room for improvements. Also, there are still so many bugs to solve. I'd like to add: 
- Stack display screen.
- A delete button or percentage button.

Bugs detected:
- No solution yet for division by 0.
- NaN showing up when pressing two operators in a row.
- Need to think how to eliminate the 0 displaying when pressing an operand after the equal button.
- Decimals not rounded.
- Now you can input decimal points as many times as you like, so... restrict that.
